## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project I worked upon my knowledge on javascript and responsive styles. The project is simple and minimal but needs a lot of concentration while working a liitile mistake may lead to chaos.

### Continued development

Though the project wanted to add a flip animation on countdown everytime the time decreases I tried but could not understan so I will keep on working the animations and using different frameworks and functions in javascript to make many more interesting projects in javascript.
